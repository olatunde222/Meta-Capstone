      <h1>Little Lemon</h1>
      <h3>Chicago</h3> 
          <p>
            Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family owned Mediterranean
            restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.
            The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and
            have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant
            has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a
            popular place for a meal any time of the day. Little Lemon is owned by
            two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States
            to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu,
            Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
            Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to
            expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
            cuisines from the mediterranean region.
